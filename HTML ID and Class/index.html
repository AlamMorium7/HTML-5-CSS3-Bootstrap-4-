  <!-- The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
  The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}. -->
