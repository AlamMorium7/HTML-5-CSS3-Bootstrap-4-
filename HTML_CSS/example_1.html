            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,  (Open and close your hands)

            How I wonder what you are.   (Open up your hands and shrug)

            Up above the world so high,  (Point at the sky)

            Like a diamond in the sky.  (Make a diamond shape with your fingers)

            winkle, twinkle, little star,   (Open and close your hands)

            How I wonder what you are.  (Open up your hands and shrug)
